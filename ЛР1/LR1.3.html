   <h1>Visual Studio Code - Open Source</h1>
   <h2 class="h21">The Repository</h2>
    <hr>
<p>This repository (<b>"Code - OSS"</b>) is where we (Microsoft) develop the Visual Studio Code product together with the community. Not only do we work on code and issues here, we also publish our roadmap, monthly iteration plans, and our endgame plans. This source code is available to everyone under the standard MIT license.</p>

<h2>Visual Studio Code</h2>

<p>Visual Studio Code is a distribution of the Code - OSS repository with Microsoft-specific customizations released under a traditional Microsoft product license.</p>

<p>Visual Studio Code combines the simplicity of a code editor with what developers need for their core edit-build-debug cycle. It provides comprehensive code editing, navigation, and understanding support along with lightweight debugging, a rich extensibility model, and lightweight integration with existing tools.</p>

<p>Visual Studio Code is updated monthly with new features and bug fixes. You can download it for Windows, macOS, and Linux on Visual Studio Code's website. To get the latest releases every day, install the Insiders build.</p>

<h2>Contributing</h2>

    <li> Review source code changes</li>
    <li>Review the documentation and make pull requests for anything from typos to additional and new content</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are interested in fixing issues and contributing directly to the code base, please see the document How to Contribute, which covers the following:</p>
<ol class="list">
    <li>How to build and run from source</li>
    <li>The development workflow, including debugging and running tests</li>
    <li>Coding guidelines</li>
    <li>Submitting pull requests</li>
    <li>Finding an issue to work on</li>
    <li>Contributing to translations</li>
</ol>
<h2>Development Container</h2>
<hr>
<p>This repository includes a Visual Studio Code Dev Containers / GitHub Codespaces development container.</p>
<ul>
    <li>For Dev Containers, use the<b> <i>Dev Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume...</i></b> command which creates a Docker volume for better disk I/O on macOS and Windows.</li>
    <li>If you already have VS Code and Docker installed, you can also click here to get started. This will cause VS Code to automatically install the Dev Containers extension if needed, clone the source code into a container volume, and spin up a dev container for use.
    <li>For Codespaces, install the GitHub Codespaces extension in VS Code, and use the <b><i>Codespaces: Create New Codespace</i></b>command.</li>
</ul>
<p>Docker / the Codespace should have at least<b>4 Cores and 6 GB of RAM (8 GB recommended)</b> to run full build. See the development container README for more information.</p>
